
- Analysed Ryanair survey results from 2012 - 2024.

- 61.18% of survey respondents do not recommend flying with Ryanair.

- Performed association rules analysis on said survey results to determine key influencers of bad reviews.

- Identified a perceived lack of value for money and ground service issues as key factors of customer dissatisfaction.

- Ryanair's business model relies on fast, efficient, and consistent aircraft turnaround times and passenger boarding and disembarkation times. 

- Performed free form text analytics to identify 3 recurring factors of ground service issues that may effect their turnaround times and customer's perception of value for money:  
	
	- Self Check-In Confusion
	- Luggage Issues
	- Pricing Structure Issues

- There were increases of complaints for pricing structure issues in 2014 and 2017 due to policy
changes for self-check-in requirements in 2014 and seating arrangements in 2017.

- Created a dashboard to easily monitor metrics and trends for customer dissatisfactions and their key influencers.

Recommendations based on findings:

	- Provide more prominent notice and placement of Self Check-in requirements
	- Create more standardized luggage policies and utilize the luggage sizer as an absolute adjudicator of luggage size requirements. The luggage sizer can be constructed with a more economical and environmentally friendly cardboard base material. 
	- The survey process needs to be updated with questions regarding self check-in awareness and luggage policy awareness to enable quick analysis of such issues in the future.
